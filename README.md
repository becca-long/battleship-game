## Battleship App

This Battleship App was the result of a front end project assignment for the DigitalCrafts 2018 Flex Cohort, in which we had to build an app using React. This app was completed for the project, but has some enhancements that will be added later on, including a Player Board where the player can place his or her ships for an opponent to try and hit as well as eventually a multi-player setup.

### To Play:

Start clicking the squares on the board to try and hit your opponent's (the computer) ships. There are 5 randomly placed ships and it is your goal to hit and sink all 5. The ships you are trying to sink are:

* Aircraft Carrier (5 pegs)
* Battleship (4 pegs)
* Cruiser (3 pegs)
* Submarine (3 pegs)
* Destroyer (2 pegs)

Try to sink your opponents battleships in as few moves as possible! Good luck!

## Technologies

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state storage and change, connected through the react-redux package.

The app also uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for the front end components.


To start the Battleship App, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Given time constraints on this project, the Battleship App is only available for running locally. However, future enhancements will include a production build and external hosting.
